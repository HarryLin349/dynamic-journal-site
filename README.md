# dynamic-journal-site

A dynamic journal site made with node.js, express, and ejs.
Compose pages by going to /compose and creating a post.
Posts will then show up on the home page in truncated form.
Clicking read more on any post or navigating to /postTitle, where postTitle is the title of a given post, will redirect users to a new page containing the contents of that post.

Made with help from The App Brewery.
Also uses bodyParser and Lodash.
